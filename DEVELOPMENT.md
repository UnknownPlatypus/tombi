## toml-test

To test if it passes [toml-test](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml-test), run the following.

```sh
# Please first install toml-test
go install github.com/toml-lang/toml-test/cmd/toml-test@latest

# Please build decode/encode test binaries
cargo build

# decode test
toml-test ./target/debug/decode

# encode test
toml-test ./target/debug/encode -encode
```

The current decode test result is stored in `toml-test/result/decode.txt`.
This was generated by the following command.

```sh
toml-test ./target/debug/decode -color=never > toml-test/result/decode.txt
```
