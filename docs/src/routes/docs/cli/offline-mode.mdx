# Offline Mode

Tombi supports `Offline Mode`; you can run Tombi without fetching remote schemas.

```bash
tombi format --offline
```

<Note>
Offline mode is specified by command line arguments, not by configuration files.
It is not a team rule issue, but an issue of your working environment.
If you want to use different schema catalogs, write it in the configuration file.

<Note>
If you are using VSCode, you can set offline mode in the VSCode settings file.

```json
{
  "tombi.args": ["--offline"]
}
```
