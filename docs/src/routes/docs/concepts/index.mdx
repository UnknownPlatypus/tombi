# Concepts

Tombi's concept is to allow any team or project to work on a TOML file with the same rules from the beginning.

## üöÄ Zero Configuration

Tombi's formatter is inspired by Python's black formatter philosophy - it has no configuration options.  
Not even line length is configurable.

Let's stop discussing the formatting rules on your team.

## üõ§Ô∏è Schema Driven

TOML is used in multiple programming languages and tools, so it needs to be formatted according to their rules.  
Don't worry! You don't need to specify the rules, Tombi will automatically apply the rules by getting the schema from the JSON Schema Store.

Those rules are determined by the schema provider, not your team.  
Just like new programming languages come with formatters from the beginning, the schema provider determines those rules as well.
