# Code Action

Code actions provide quick refactoring operations for TOML files.

## Available Code Actions

### Convert between Dotted Keys and Inline Tables

Transform between Dotted Key format and Inline Table format:

```toml
# Dotted key
foo.bar = 1

# Can be converted to inline table
foo = { bar = 1 }
```

<Tip>
This conversion is only available when there's a single key-value pair in the structure.
</Tip>

## Configuration

Code actions can be enabled or disabled in your configuration:

```toml
[lsp]
code-action.enabled = true  # Default: true
```

## How to Use

Code actions are triggered differently depending on your editor:

- **VS Code**: Click on the lightbulb icon that appears when your cursor is on a supported structure, or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+.` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+.` (macOS)
- **Neovim**: Use the `:lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()` command or bind it to a key
- **Other LSP-compatible editors**: Refer to your editor's documentation for triggering code actions
