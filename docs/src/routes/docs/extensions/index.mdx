# Extensions

Tombi may support extensions in the future to provide better editor experiences for configuration files of specific systems, such as Cargo.toml.

- Go Definition
- Hover
- Completion
- etc...

However, since developing extensions and designing APIs takes time, we will experimentally support some extension-like features built into the core.
