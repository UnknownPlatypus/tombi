# Tombi: TOML Toolkit

Welcome to the Tombi documentation!

Tombi(é³¶) is a powerful [TOML](https://toml.io/) `Formatter`, `Linter`, and `Language Server`
designed to help you maintain clean and consistent TOML files.

## Getting Started

Visit our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/installation) to begin using Tombi in your projects.

## Why Tombi?
TOML is used in many projects such as [pyproject](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).  

TOML is a good configuration language better than JSON and YAML.  
JSON is a data description language and cannot include comments.  
YAML has a complex specification and may interpret data that the user did not intend implicitly.

YAML has an excellent [Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) created by RedHat.  

So, I needed a Language Server for TOML.
