# Tombi: TOML Toolkit

Welcome to the Tombi documentation!

Tombi(é³¶) is a powerful TOML `Formatter`, `Linter`, and `Language Server`
designed to help you maintain clean and consistent TOML files.

## Getting Started

Visit our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/installation) to begin using Tombi in your projects.

## Why Tombi?
I liked TOML better than JSON/YAML for the project's configuration file;

but I was using the project's configuration file in YAML for the team's project because of the excellent [RedHat Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server).

I wanted to replace it with TOML.
