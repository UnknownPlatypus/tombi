# Magic Trailing Comma

Magic Trailing Comma is a feature inspired by the Black formatter, which automatically adds trailing commas to arrays and tables that span multiple lines. This feature makes version control more efficient by ensuring clean diffs when adding new elements in the future.

## Basic Usage

When array elements fit on a single line, no trailing comma is added:

```toml
# Before formatting
dependencies = ["tombi", "biome", "prettier"]

# After formatting
dependencies = ["tombi", "biome", "prettier"]
```

When elements span multiple lines, a trailing comma is automatically added:

```toml
# Before formatting
dependencies = [
  "tombi",
  "biome",
  "prettier"
]

# After formatting
dependencies = [
  "tombi",
  "biome",
  "prettier",
]
```

## Table Examples

The same behavior applies to TOML tables:

```toml
# Before formatting
[package]
name = "my-app"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = [
  "John Doe",
  "Jane Smith"
]

[dependencies]
tombi = "1.0.0"
biome = "1.0.0"

# After formatting
[package]
name = "my-app"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = [
  "John Doe",
  "Jane Smith",
]

[dependencies]
tombi = "1.0.0",
biome = "1.0.0",
```

This feature provides several benefits:

- Creates cleaner diffs when adding new elements
- Makes reordering elements easier
- Improves code consistency
- Reduces version control conflicts in multi-developer environments
