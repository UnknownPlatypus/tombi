# Treatment of Comments

Tombi performs impressive comment interpretation to support automatic sorting.

Most users will learn how comments are handled by observing the formatter's behavior,
but this page is provided for users who want a more systematic understanding of how comments are treated.

## Terminology

Generally, there are three types of comments:

1. Leading comments
2. Tailing comment
3. Dangling comments

Type 1 and 2 exist surrounding an element.
Leading comments are on the lines before an element and can exist across multiple consecutive lines.
Tailing comments exist at the end of the line after an element and can only exist once.

```toml
# leading comment1
# leading comment2
key = "value" # tailing comment
```

Type 3, Dangling comments, are comments not associated with any element.

```toml
# dangling comment1
# dangling comment2

key = "value"

# dangling comment3

# dangling comment4
```

When dangling comments exist, automatic sorting becomes challenging.

For example, consider the following TOML file:

```toml
# dangling comment1

key2 = "value2"

# dangling comment2

# leading comment1
# leading comment2
key1 = "value1" # tailing comment
# dangling comment3

# dangling comment4
```

When sorting keys in ascending order, key1 should come before key2.
But where should dangling comment2 go? Before key1 or after key2?
Tombi cannot determine which element the comment is directed at.

Should we use AI to interpret the comment content?

No, Tombi solves this problem by establishing special rules.

## Limiting the Use of Dangling Comments

Tombi limits where dangling comments can be used.
They are allowed before and after key values, and before and after the brackets of arrays and inline tables.

```toml
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

key = "value"

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

[table]
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

key = [
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
  
  "value",
  
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
]

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

[[array_of_table]]
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

key = {
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
  
  key = "value"
  
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
}

# dangling comment
# dangling comment
```

<Note>
Dangling comments can be separated by blank lines, allowing multiple groups to be placed.

```toml
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment
```
</Note>

<Tip>
In the proposed TOML v1.1.0, it allows multi-line and trailing commas of Inline Table.
</Tip>

Now, what happens to dangling comments in other locations?

## Merging Leading Comments

Consider a case where comments exist between key values, where dangling comments are not allowed:

```toml
key1 = 1

# dangling comment?
# dangling comment?

# dangling comment?
# dangling comment?

key2 = 2
```

In such cases, Tombi treats dangling comments as leading comments and removes blank lines between comments:

```toml
key1 = 1
# dangling comment?
# dangling comment?
# dangling comment?
# dangling comment?
key2 = 2
```

With this special pre-processing, Tombi maintains the meaning of comments while enabling automatic sorting.

## Summary of Comment Handling

Let's look at a more specific example to understand how Tombi handles comments:

```toml
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
key1 = 1 # tailing comment

# leading comment
# leading comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
key2 = 2 # tailing comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
[table]
# dangling comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
key1 = 1 # tailing comment

# leading comment
# leading comment

# leading comment
key2 = [
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
  
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  "value1", # tailing comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  "value2", # tailing comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
  
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
] # tailing comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
[[array_of_table]]
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

key1 = {
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
  
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  key1 = "value1", # tailing comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  key2 = "value2" # tailing comment
  # leading comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  , # tailing comment
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
} # tailing comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# dangling comment
```

After formatting, the comments are rearranged as follows:

```toml
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
key1 = 1  # tailing comment
# leading comment
# leading comment
# leading comment
# leading comment
key2 = 2  # tailing comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
[table]
# dangling comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
# leading comment
key1 = 1  # tailing comment
# leading comment
# leading comment
# leading comment
key2 = [
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  "value1",  # tailing comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  "value2",  # tailing comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
]  # tailing comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# leading comment
[[array_of_table]]
# dangling comment
# dangling comment

key1 = {
  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  key1 = "value1",  # tailing comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  key2 = "value2"  # tailing comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  # leading comment
  ,  # tailing comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment

  # dangling comment
  # dangling comment
}  # tailing comment

# dangling comment
# dangling comment

# dangling comment
```

By interpreting comments in this way, Tombi enables automatic sorting ðŸš€

## `:schema` Directive

Tombi can embed JSON Schema information in TOML files in the same way as Taplo.

```toml
#:schema your-schema.json
key = "value"
```

However, when auto-sorting, to prevent the `#:schema` directive from being accidentally placed anywhere other than the beginning of the document,
Tombi first moves the comment group containing the `#:schema` directive to the beginning of the document before performing auto-sorting.

```toml
#:schema your-schema.json

key = "value"
```
