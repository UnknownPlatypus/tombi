# Formatter Overview

Tombi's formatter ensures consistent styling of your TOML files by automatically applying formatting rules.

Tombi's formatter is inspired by [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).  
The current policy is more strict, and there is no line-width specification.  
The default line width is 80 characters.
