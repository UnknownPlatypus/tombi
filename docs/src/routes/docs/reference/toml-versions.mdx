# TOML Versions

## TOML v1.1.0
[TOML v1.1.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/928) has not been released.

The formatter of Tombi will show its true power in `v1.1.0-preview`, but be careful.

Many existing systems ([Cargo.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)) are `v1.0.0`, and the default TOML version of Tombi is also `v1.0.0`.
