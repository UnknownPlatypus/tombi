# Differences from Taplo

[Taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) is already famous as a TOML Language Server.
However, I rewrote a new Language Server for the following purposes.

- Support for TOML v1.1.0 (preview)
- Formatter inspired by Python's [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) (Support for [magic trailing comma](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#the-magic-trailing-comma))
- A formatter with stable behavior
