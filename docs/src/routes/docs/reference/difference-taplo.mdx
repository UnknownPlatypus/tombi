# Differences from Taplo

[Taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) is already famous as a TOML Language Server.
However, I rewrote a new Language Server for the following purposes.

## Magic Trailing Comma
Formatter inspired by Python's [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) (Support for [magic trailing comma](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#the-magic-trailing-comma))

This idea is great, it allows the user's code formatting intent to be expressed in code, not in a configuration.

I wanted to bring this idea to TOML.

## Support for TOML v1.1.0 (preview)
TOML will allow multi-line inline tables and trailing commas in the future v1.1.0.  
This feature makes the magic trailing comma feature more valuable.  
To provide that experience, Tombi will support TOML v1.1.0 features ahead of time.

## Stable Behavior Formatting
Taplo has a fundamental problem with the lexer.  
When formatting an incomplete TOML file, the AST deletes elements.  
I uninstalled Taplo ðŸ˜¢

## Personal Study
I was writing a [PostgreSQL Language Server](https://github.com/UniqueVision/plpgsql-lsp).
At that time, I was using the official parser of PostgreSQL, so I can't implement formatter and other features.

So, I wanted to create a complete Language Server.
And I still want to get a SQL Language Server.

As a simple exercise, I wanted to create a Language Server for a language with a smaller language specification and practical use.

So I chose TOML.

## Use TOML for project configuration file
I liked TOML better than JSON/YAML for the project's configuration file;

but I was using the project's configuration file in YAML for the team's project because of the excellent [RedHat Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server).

I wanted to replace it with TOML.
