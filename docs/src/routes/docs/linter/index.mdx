# Linter

Tombi implements TOML syntax checking, warnings for deprecated writing methods, and validation based on JSON Schema.

<Note>
Although the configuration items in the configuration file are currently not available,
we plan to add a feature to adjust the level of deprecated warnings.  
(Currently, a warning is issued if an empty key is specified.)
