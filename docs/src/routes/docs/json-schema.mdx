# Json Schema

TOML itself may add [schema specifications](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/792),
but like Taplo, Tombi is also trying to add validation functions to the linter that support [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Currently, we are considering adding special information called `x-tombi-*` to JSON Schema.


## Formatting
### x-tombi-toml-version
This key is for automatically determining the TOML version.
Currently, only `v1.0.0` is supported.
`v1.1.0-preview` is also available to experience, which proposes awesome features such as allowing the trailing comma in Inline Table.

Until `v1.1.0` is released officially, please specify `v1.0.0`.


### x-tombi-table-keys-order

For automatically sorting table keys like `[dependencies]`

There are three strategies.
- `ascending`
- `descending`
- `schema`

<Note>
If you use `schema`, it is not recommended to use `additionalProperties` or `patternProperties`.
  They are not sorted after `properties` and placed at the end.
</Note>

## Language Gap
TOML is a different language from JSON, so applying JSON Schema to TOML is not a one-to-one relationship.  
However, JSON Schema is useful as a tool for representing the structure of TOML. And there are already many schema assets.  

Tombi overcomes the language gap by using an abbreviation to represent JSON Schema that does not exist in TOML.
