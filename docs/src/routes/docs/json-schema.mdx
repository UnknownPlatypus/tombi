# Json Schema

TOML itself may add [schema specifications](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/792),
but like Taplo, Tombi is also trying to add validation functions to the linter that support [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Currently, we are considering adding special information called `x-tombi-*` to JSON Schema.


## Formatting
### x-tombi-toml-version
This key is for automatically determining the TOML version.
Currently, only `v1.0.0` is supported.
`v1.1.0-preview` is also available to experience, which proposes awesome features such as allowing the trailing comma in Inline Table.

Until `v1.1.0` is released officially, please specify `v1.0.0`.


### x-tombi-table-key-order-by

ðŸš§ This feature is not implemented yet ðŸš§

For automatically sorting tables like `[dependencies]`

There are three strategies.
- `ascending-order`
- `descending-order`
- `schema-order`

<Note>
If you use `schema-order`, it is not recommended to use `additionalProperties` or `patternProperties`.
  They are not sorted after `properties` and placed at the end.
