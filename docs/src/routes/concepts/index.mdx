# Core Concepts

## Zero Configuration Formatter

Tombi's formatter is inspired by Python's black formatter philosophy - it has no configuration options. Not even line length is configurable. This opinionated approach eliminates bike-shedding and ensures consistent formatting across all projects.

## Schema Provider Driven

The JsonSchema provider determines the formatting rules. This means that everyone working with the same domain shares the same formatting rules, promoting consistency and reducing friction in collaboration.
