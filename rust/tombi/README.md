Reserved package for tombi.

## NOTE
In the future, we may provide a library that automatically reads tombi's configuration file and generates formatted text.
It may provide serde's Serialize/Deserialize and tombi::Document.
It uses the [toml crate](https://crates.io/crates/toml), but if this crate is implemented, it may be excluded from the dependencies.
